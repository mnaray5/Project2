        <p style = "font-size: 27px; margin: 20px;"> Welcome to Hangman! Hangman is typically a guessing game for two or more players. One player will think of a word, phrase or sentence and the other players must try to guess it by suggesting letters, but have a specific number of guesses. <br>
           The classic game is said to have been first mentioned in 1894, in Alice Gommes "Birds, Beasts, and Fishes", being alive for over 100 years! The game, which lacked the imaged hangman in the gallows, was originally played with paper and pencil, by keeping score on the number of attempts to guess the word.
            <br> Here, we have no paper and pencil, but a digitized version of the classic game from your childhood, featuring the hangman in the gallows! Much like the paper and pencil version, you will guess a word based on a specific category of your choosing! <br>
